# Weather React
This is a sample real-time and 5 day weather forecast web application built using react to view the weather forecast.
This is my first React SPA! Huzzah!

# Prerequsites
* npm 
* node

# Build Instructions
1. `npm install` to install all node modules specified in the package.json
2. `npm run build` to build the react application into the build folder
3. `npm start` will serve the application on localhost:3000# weather-react

# Next Steps
1. `remove deprecated variants` This weather app has some deprecated typography headings from Material-ui. e.g. Display4 will have to become H4.
2. Edit styles to be more complete and aligned within a customized color palette.
3. Add loading message for when the app is fetching current lcoation.
4. Skeleton loading UI instead of default coordinates for initial load.
5. Properly cache geoLoacation in localStorage
6. Include Highs and Lows on currentCard
7. Include Highs and Lows on forecastCards
8. Add return/enter button to search for new city (just onClick currently)

# TODOs
1. Maybe include high and lows on larger currentCard
2. Change icons to Skycons animated icons and have them play the animation
    1. Possible inclusion of Github branch to include colored versions.
3. Push to new Github repo under my andrewmiller.co@gmail.com account (need to create)
4. Write the README.md documentation I need to for the project.
5. Host the code somewhere.
